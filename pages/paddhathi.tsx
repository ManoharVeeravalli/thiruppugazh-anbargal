      Bhaya Bhakti To get the restless mind to concentrate on Muruga and sing in his praise Remove selfishness and anger from the mind and be able to sing in praise. Everybody in the Bhajan should surrender at the feet of Muruga Remain physically and mentally in the Bhajan throughout.
      This paddhathi (set by our Guruji Sri AS Raghavan ) is being put up for all to follow.
      It is always good to refresh ourselves periodically, reminding ourselves about all the goodness in the old traditions, and continue to preserve them.
      The discipline, concentration, highly musical rendering and bhakthi-bhaava are the highlights of this paddhathi that has drawn people,young and the old alike, from all walks of life to join this movement over the last 60 years.`}
